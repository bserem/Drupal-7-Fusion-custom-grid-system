This pack of files shouldn't really be considered a theme.
It needs drupal fusion to work (has been tested with fusion7)
and a subtheme of it that has the specified changes in the .info file
and the custom-grid css file in the css folder.

This project started because I wanted to get funky with Git and
I wanted to share a 936px grid made for a client of mine
with the rest of the community.
